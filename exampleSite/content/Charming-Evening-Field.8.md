# Stuffed tomato with gravy

This is my first Indian recipe in the process of migration to this new website. I just want to say that curry is not really a thing in India. Any dish with gravy to it we call it jhol as in any dish with gravy or not dry (sukhi is dry in hindi) ;) So it's not that Indians have a curry masala, gravies are made of different spices like any other dish would be. 

  
**Ingredients**

\- 2.5 Medium size tomato

\- 1 Medium size potato

\- 1 Onion (for the gravy)

\- 1 Garlic clove

\- 3.5cm Fresh ginger

\- 0.25tsp Turmeric powder

\- 0.25tsp Coriander powder

\- 2tbsp Oil

\- 1tsp Cumin seeds

\- 1tbsp Chopped coriander

\- To taste Salt

\- To taste Chili

\- 0.5 Onion (for the stuffing)

\- 0.5 Tomato (for the gravy)

  
**Method**

1\. Cut the top of the two tomatoes to be able to scoop out the pulp and close after stuffing.

2\. Scoop out the pulp

3\. Cook the potato to be able to mash it

4\. Once cooked, mash the potato.

5\. Finely chop the onion (for the stuffing part)

6\. Mix the chopping onion with the mash potato

7\. Add salt and chili powder to the mix (according to your preference)

8\. Mix the stuffing and fill the tomatoes.

9\. Once stuffed, put the top layer back.

10\. Tip: if you see that your tomatoes aren’t super stable, feel free to use a toothpick to hold them together.

11\. In a pan, heat the oil and add the cumin seeds.

12\. Chop the onion (for the gravy) and blend it to get a paste.

13\. Once the cumin seeds turn brown, add the onion paste in the pan and cook for 10 minutes.

14\. Chop and blend the tomato (reserved for the gravy)

15\. Once the onion paste turns brown, add the tomato paste.

16\. Cook for another 5 minutes

17\. Add the water and add the stuffed tomato in the pan.

18\. Cook until the tomatoes’ skin gets soft.

19\. Garnish with chopped coriander

20\. Serve with rice or chapati.
