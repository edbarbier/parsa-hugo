This was an impromptu weekend in Italy over a long weekend thanks to the last bank holiday before Christmas.

There are days when I get exhausted of planning. I don’t like project management kind of planning but at work a lot of us have to project manage on a day to day basis. So sometimes, in personal life, I just don’t want to decide where to go, where to eat etc. I hate those moments in groups or even with my fiancé when the response on where should we go is “I’m easy”. Well, I am easy too so let’s just eat at home or get a kebab from the = corner-shop. And suddenly the response is - Ah non! Oh, yes! because you were easy. ;) There are times when end up booking 2-3 restaurants to have some solution and to not have crappy food. People think I am the best planner. Not I just can't eat bad food! Enough ranting let's go through the "no planning" weekend fun. :)

It was the weekend of September 21st in Switzerland and me and my fiancé wanted to explore a new place. And there was this indecisive moment again so I decided we will drive down to Italy with no bookings done. We stopped at the fist decathlon, bought campaign tent. This was our first tent together. I have personally camped only once when I was on a school trip.

Camping gear cost

* Tent for 3 (we wanted a spacious tent) - 79 euros
* Mattress for 2 - 22 euros
* We had our duvet from home for some comfort. haha

We then drove towards lake Como. It was quite late in the night. We arrived at the first camping site.

**Lake Como**

We were kind of anxious to find a camping site late at night. We entered this first camping site [Camping Aurora](http://campeggioaurora.it/index.php). It was pitch dark with a dim light at a table and some people playing guitar. :) The camping site owners were really nice and they offered us a small spot to host our tent. It's a small camping site right by the lake. It's a famous surfing spot. After setting up our tent we went to a nearby restaurant, [Pizzeria Lumin](https://lumin.it/). With the first bite of pizza and the smell of a typical Italian soup, we knew we are in Italy and all the long drive fatigue was off with the pizza. 

We had a peaceful overnight sleep other than the usual camping late night or early morning noise. The morning at the site was a bit painful. The toilets were not as clean as one would expect during COVID. The shower can full of cobwebs with no hot water. :( 

So we were lucky to find a camping site late at night but not that great experience. 

We drove across the lake and stopped to explore the little towns around. 

After a painful morning at the camp, I wanted to make sure we have a good lunch. I went on my usual hunt of finding the best restaurants in the area.  I kept searching and found a restaurant around 30 mins drive in a town called Bellano. I saw some good photos of the food and 4.4 stars on Google but there were on 41 reviews so I wasn't 100% sure. But we went for it. 

Trust me if you are in the Lake Como area, you MUST VISIT [Restaurant Alkimia](https://www.ristorante-alkimia.com/). The most delicious food with the most generous staff.

After this soulful meal, we made our way to the Lake Iseo. 

**Lake Iseo**

On the way to Lake Iseo we made a booking at [Camp Iseo](http://www.campingiseo.it/). I was a bit concerned if it will be clean or not but the reviews were fine. We were delightfully surprised when we arrived at our next camping site. It's was so well maintained, very clean, very nice people and we were welcomed with a fresh glass of fine. :) Oh this was the best place with the best service for 26 euros per night. 

I loved Lake Iseo a lot. It was calmer, smaller and gorgeous. The city of Iseo is beautiful.It reminded me of Cambrills in Spain. 

We didn't have more than 12-16 hrs so we did a small boat ride on the lake, stopped at one of the small islands for a walk and that's it. One can easily spend a few days exploring the beautiful natural parks, islands and hikes around. 

If you are in Italy, or let's say I am in Italy, I have to visit an outlet village. We spend 2-3 hrs in one of the outlet villages next to Lake Iseo but nah couldn't find anything. :/

On our way back to Vevey, we stopped in Aosta Valley for food. We found an amazing Sushi place, [I-Sushi](https://www.isushi.it/it/ristorante/33). OMGGG the sushis were amazing! Don't ask me why but for some reason my finacé loves doing trips to Italy for sushi. LOL 

Well folks here was our mini, long weekend trip chasing lakes and good food. Please comment or reach out to us on IG @momentsthroughthelens or @flavorsdiscovered in case you have any questions.
