**Cookie dough cake**

I tried this cake on my birthday aka Star Wars day in 2020. :P It was a lot for only two people. This cake will serve min. 8 people unless you and your loved ones can eat two big cookies in one go. :) 

**Ingredients**

\- 60 gr Sugar

\- 80 gr Brown sugar

\- 1 Egg

\- 1 Egg yolk

\- 1tsp Vanila essence

\- 220 gr All purpose flour

\- 1tsp Baking soda

\- 60 gr Chocolate chips

\- 1 For frosting

\- 45gr Cream

\- 135 gr Cooking chocolate

\- 25 gr Butter

\- 140 gr Salted butter

**Method**

1\. Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees centigrade.

2\. In a stand-mixer, mix butter and sugar for 2 minutes.

3\. Add vanilla essence, egg and egg yolk to the mix and mix for another two minutes to make a consistent mixture.

4\. Add the flour and baking soda and mix to form a homogenous dough.

5\. Keeping two table spoon of chocolate chips aside, gently fold in the remaining chocolate chips into the dough.

6\. Roll out the dough in a 22 cm diameter baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining chocolate chips on the top and press them gently.

7\. Bake for about 30 mins at 180 degrees. The top should be light brown and the inside should be soft. Let the cookie cool completely before unfolding it. Transfer to a serving dish once cooled down.

8\. Frosting

9\. Gently melt the chocolate in a microwave or double boiler without burning the chocolate.

10\. Heat the cream on a low flame. Add in the melted chocolate, whisking with a hand whisker.

11\. Add butter to the mixture. Let it cool down outside for 10 minutes and move to the fridge for about 30 minutes.

12\. Keep watching to make sure it doesnâ€™t become too hard.

13\. When the consistency looks good enough to be piped add the mix to a piping bag and make small swirls all around the circumference of your beautiful cookie cake.

14\. Sprinkle smarties or sprinkles or little hearts.

15\. Enjoy the beautiful cookie-cake!
