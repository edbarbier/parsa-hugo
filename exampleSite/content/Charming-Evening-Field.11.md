This is my favorite recipe from my very generous Mom. Vegetable pulav, home made version of biryani quite commonly cooked in Indian families.

**Ingredients**

\- 200 gr Basmati rice

\- 150 gr Cauliflower florets

\- 1 Medium size tomato

\- 70 gr Green peas (frozen or fresh)

\- 1 Medium size red onion

\- 1 Small black cardamom (deseeded)

\- 5 Peppercorns (full)

\- 3 Cloves

\- 1tsp Cumin seeds

\- 3tbsp Butter (for cooking)

\- 2tbsp Coriander

\- 1 Green chili (Optional)

\- 1For frying Oil

**Method**

1\. Soak the rice in water (make sure all the rice is covered)

2\. Finely chop the onion (long strips)

3\. Heat the oil in a pan and brown the chopped onion

4\. Remove the onion from the pan and fry the cardamom, peppercorns and cloves (quick browning)

5\. In a blender, blend together the fried onion, the spices you just browned and the tomato (diced).

6\. In a pressure cooker, heat the butter (ideally ghee, but normal butter will do just fine too), add cumin seeds and the onion/tomato blended paste.

7\. Add diced potato, cauliflower, peas, green chili (finely chopped) and salt.

8\. Cook for 2 minutes

9\. Add water in the pressure cooker (the equivalent of 1.5x times the volume of your ingredients) and bring to boil.

10\. Drain the water from the rice and add the rice in the cooker.

11\. Close the cooker and cook for 1 whistle. Wait for the full pressure to release.

12\. Once cooked, garnish with chopped coriander and serve with Raita dip.
