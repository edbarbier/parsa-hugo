In India we have a variety of lentils and they are very delicious by themselves. With a little spice and butter / oil the flavor multiplies. My favorite lentils are tuar (yellow in color), Moong (green in color).

\- 225 gr Yellow lentil (Tuar aka Arhar daal)

\- 0.5L Water

\- 0.25 tsp Turmeric powder

\- 3 tbsp Ghee (or butter)

\- 2 tsp Cumin seeds

\- 1 Small onion (not too big)

\- 2 Tomatoes

\- 1 Garlic clove

\- 2 tbsp Coriander

\- To spice up Green chili (Optional)

\- To taste Salt

**Method**

1\. Wash the lentils

2\. Add the lentils, water, turmeric powder and salt in a pressure cook. Cook for two whistles and let it sit until the whole pressure is released.

3\. In a pan, head the ghee (or butter)

4\. Add the cumin seeds and let them roast a little until they turn dark brown.

5\. Chop the garlic and add it to the pan.

6\. Finily chop the onion and add it to the pan to brown.

7\. Once the onion is brown, dice and add the tomatoes. Let the mixture cook until it everything blends together nicely. A good check is to wait until the ghee gets released in the mix.

8\. Add a cup of water and the boiled lentils.

9\. Let simmer for 5-7 minutes.

10\. Garnish with chopped coriander and serve with rice, chapati or paratha.
