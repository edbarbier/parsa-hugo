In restaurants in the North of India and in the centre as well you might find this starter which is called Hara bhara kebab which means green kebab. Of course thanks to the blend of spinach and green peas in it.

**Ingredients**

\- 150 gr Potatoes

\- 130 gr Green peas

\- 50 gr Spinash leaves

\- 3 tbsp Corn flour

\- 2.5 cm Fresh ginger

\- 0.5 Green chili

\- 1tbsp Coriander

\- 0.25 tsp Chaat Masala (Optional)

\- To cook Oil

\- To taste Salt

**Method**

1\. In a large bowl, mix all the ingredients.

2\. Divide the dough in equal parts. Donâ€™t worry if it is sticky at this stage.

3\. In a non-stick pan, spread a bit of oil and add small piece of dough (shaped like rough rounds)

4\. Cook on both sides until the kebabs get brown.

5\. You can optionally press a cashew nuts to give the kebabs a crunchy nutty taste.

Tips

If the mix is too soft you can add more potato or binding agents like cornflour, bread crumbs.
