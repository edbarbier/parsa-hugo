Mashed potato for Christmas, Thanksgiving and wintery nights! Trust me even if you dont like mashed potato you need to try it to give it another chance and you will fall in love ;) 

**Recipe**

Ingredients

* 350 gm boiled potatoes
* 70 ml cooking cream (I used green bottle of [Elle & Vire)](https://www.amazon.fr/Elle-Vire-Cr%C3%A8me-Enti%C3%A8re-Normandie/dp/B00LI3YJVO)
* 1 tsp dried rosemary
* 1 garlic clove
* Salt to taste
* Pepper to taste
* 50 gm melted butter
* 25 gm grated gruyere
* 10 gm blue cheese

**Method**

* Peel the potatoes and mash them with a masher or a flat bottom glass or a wide bottom spoon
* Heat the cooking cream in a pan. Add dried rosemary leaves and garlic clove. Let it simmer on low flame for 5 minutes. Keep stirring to ensure it doesn't stick at the bottom of the pan.
* Start adding warm cream to the potatoes 2-3 tsp at a time and fold in gently into the potatoes. Make sure you really add little by little and fold as if done in a rush it might lead to a running mashed potato.
* Once the cream is folded in do the same with butter and then the cheese and salt and pepper.
* Add a slice of butter on the top and eat with a nice gravy.
