Playing with spices and other food items to create different flavors is my daily detox moment in my kitchen. Since I know what's ASMR thanks to my profession I can say that moments are my ASMR moments (calming, pleasurable feeling often accompanied by a tingling sensation:)) 

I am not a professional cook but me and my finac√© look to experiment different cuisine at home. He is very boldly innovative than I am. I can be sometime very particular about what flavors can go together and what's a clear no-no. 

My idea of cooking is not aiming for perfection by following recipes to the T but use my intuition, senses and play, if I fail no big deal there is always a restaurant open for a take away. Once you develop a basic understanding of playing with food you will be amazed by the flavors discovered in your cozy kitchen. 

Alors, don't be scared or stressed just have fun!
