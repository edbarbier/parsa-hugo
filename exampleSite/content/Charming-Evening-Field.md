I didn't realise the craving for staple diet, in my case, roti (chapati) until I couldn't due to some weeks of sickness when I was a kid. Now after living in Europe for the last 7 years I can live on different things and not eat chapati for weeks.

**Ingredients**

\- 250 gr Wheat flour

\- 25 cl Water

\- 1t sp Salt

**Method**

1\. In a kitchen robot, add the flour and the salt

2\. Run the robot at Speed 1 (Low speed) for four minutes while slowly adding the water

3\. The flour should become a non sticky ball of dough.If the flour is a non sticky ball then itâ€™s good to be used. If not then add 2-3 tbsp of flour or if too dry then add a few tbsps of water and run for one more minute.

4\. Take enough dough to make a ball 2-3 inch (5-7 cm) in diameter.

5\. Using a bit of dusting flour, roll the dough to make a circular chapati 2 mm thickness.

6\. On a flat pan, cook the chapati from both side until you get brown bubbles. If need be, press during the process to ensure the chapati is cooked evenly.

**Tip** - Look for the tip under Paratha recipe. :)
