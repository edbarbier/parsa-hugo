**Top 5 restaurants in our little village, Vevey, Switzerland** 

Vevey is a very small town on Lake Geneva. It's the hometown or little village of Nestl√©, the big name behind some of the famous brands like Nespresso, KITKAT, Nescafe, Cerelac, Buitoni, Purina pet food etc. HAHA. It's also the place where the AWESOME Charlie Chaplin had spent last years of his life. 

It's petite and an gorgeous place. It's so peaceful and right by the lake, and full of good places to eat. Five good places to eat for our little town is a good number. ;)
