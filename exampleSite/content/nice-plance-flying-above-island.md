**A long weekend in the Interlaken region**

For the first time in 2020, I managed to take a few days off and travel to a place we haven't visited until last weekend. It was our planned wedding weekend until we had to move it to next year due to COVID chaos. Well it was still one of the best weekend we spent with our best friends and my fiancé's sister.

We had effectively 2.5 days. But it was full of so many activities that it almost felt like 5 days long fun.

### Bachalpsee

Bachalpsee is a lake situated at an altitude of 2,265m. It's a tranquil and picturquese location. A lake split in two and surrounded by gorgeous snow clad mountain, Schreckhorn. It's one of the few locations which look exactly the same as you would see in any Instagram or Google images. The best part is that it's so easy to access.

We started our hike from Grindelwald which is around 25 mins walk from Interlaken. From Grindelwald one can take the funicular to the top of the First mountain. From First (altitude 2167m), it's around 3kms, 50 mins hike to this gorgeous blue lake reflecting the white snow. If you are an avid hiker you can hike from Grindelwald to First which is a bit medium difficulty hike spanning around 7.3km. If you have more energy you can continue the hike to Faulhorn, 1.5 hours hike. If not relax at Bachalpsee and head back to First.

Price of Funi - 34 CHF for adults one way (You can get a discount if you have a Swiss traveller pass. There are no student discounts.)

Time - The last funi down from First is at 1730

The funi stops at two more locations before arriving at First. There are 4 kinds of [adventure](https://www.jungfrau.ch/de-ch/grindelwaldfirst/adventure-package/) sport one can explore at First.

If you are not scared of heights do take a walk around the mountain on the Tissot bridge. It's breathtaking walk.

We had a tough time finding a parking as we arrived at Grindelwald at around 1230 pm on a Friday afternoon. Lesson learnt - dont start hiking so late or take a train from Interlaken to Grindelwald. Some hotels or camping sites might offer a free or discounted train ticket.

### Harder Klum - Top of Interlaken

For this gorgeous view of Interlaken between the two lakes, Thun and Brienz, if you are fit to climb up I would highly recommend to hike from the Harder Klum station. Harder Klum is situated at an altitude of 1323m. It says at the starting point that the hike is for around 2hr 20 min but it took us around 1hr 40 mins. the hike is pretty easy except for the last 30 mins which is a narrow and a bit steeper path in the forest. In case you cannot hike don't worry! You can take the funicular and be on the top in 10 mins.

Price for the Funi - 17 CHF one way. If you have knee problem then for sure take the funi on the way back.

Hike difficulty - medium

Time - 1hr 40 min to 2hrs one way

You can enjoy drinks, lunch or dinner at the beautiful restaurant on the top which is built around this beautiful monastery. You can also plan your trip to watch the Sun setting from the top.

### Lauterbrunnen

After hiking up Harder Klum we wanted to make the most of the sunny day in Interlaken so we headed towards the valley of waterfalls. Lauterbrunnen literally means a lot of waterfalls. It's very simple walk around the valley which one can opt to do as a loop or only one way.

We parked our car at a parking located just before the street, Eyelti. We walked from there for around 25 mins to arrive at Trümmelbach. We arrived there at 5 pm and the board read as open from 0900 to 1700. We didn't want to give up so we checked at the ticket counter and to our luck they let us in. I guess, until mid September, the waterfall entry is open until 1730 hours.

After the entrance there is a lift which takes you up to the waterfalls in a minute. Once you exit the lift you can take the stairs to waterfalls 6 to 10. It's the most forceful sight of water I have ever seen. It's so fierce and amazing. The force gave me goosebumps.

The temperature drops a bit and the waterfall can make you wet so do take a jacket. There are around 120 -160 stairs in between the waterfalls 6 to 10 but it's not steep and well maintained.

Once you are back at the lift and your knee support then you can walk down the stairs exploring waterfalls 1 to 5. If not you can take the lift back.

Entry price - 10 CHF per person (no students discount)

### Places to stay

We stayed at [**Hotel Beausite**](https://www.beausite.ch/en/). It was a lovely place with very spacious and clean rooms. The owners of the hotel are very kind. The breakfast is good. It's a very centrally located place. All in all a good location and good value for money.

Our friends stayed at the camping site, [Alpenbick](https://www.camping-alpenblick.ch/82/preise). They had a good stay as well. The place is right next to the lake with a preserved forest area for a walk in the nature.

### Places to Eat

After the hikes, a foundue meal was a well deserved reward. we ate fondue at the resturant [Taverne](https://hotelinterlaken.ch/en/gastronomy/). They do delicious and cute homemade bread with the fondue. Avg. meal price - 40 CHF pp incl. drinks

We also tried Italian meal at [Sapori](https://ristorante-sapori.ch/en/). The pizzas were yum! And the tiramisu was my favorite part of the whole meal. :P Avg. meal price - 40 CHF pp excl. drinks

On the rainy Sunday afternoon, we walked around the cute Sunday market infront of the Hotel Victoria and the giant merry-go-round. After this small walk if you manage to skip the warm soup, churros and racelette stalls you can indulge into soul soup and rosti at [Cafe Paris](https://cafe-de-paris-interlaken.ch/). Avg. meal price - 25 CHF pp

Enjoy this beautiful region surrounded by lakes.
