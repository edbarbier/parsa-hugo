Homemade pizzas are the best especially when made by my lovely Belgian. 

**Recipe**

Ingredients 

\- 20 gr Fresh or Instant Yeast

\- 400 gr Flour

\- 2 tsp Salt

\- 2 tbsp Olive oil

\- 25 cl Lukewarm water

\- 2 Tomato

\- 2 Onions

\- 125 gr Mozarella

\- 50 gr Grated cheese

\- 3 Mushrooms

\- 50 gr Green peppers

\- Oregano to taste 

**Method**

Dough:

* Pour some of the lukewarm water in a glass and add the yeast
* Mix and let the mixture rest for a few minute, bubbles should start forming at the surface
* Once bubbles form, add the olive oil and gently mix.
* In a large bowl, put the flour, salt and the yeast.
* Start mixing and slowly add more water.
* Mix until the dough stops sticking, add more flour if the dough is too liquid or more water if it is too dry.
* Once the dough detaches from the sides of your bowl, transfer it to a floured surface and knead it for a 3-4 minutes with lightly floured hands.
* Put the dough back in the large bowl, cover with foil or with a piece of cloth.
* Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. Ideally you want to keep the dough is a warm environment, directly under the sun light or in the oven ( 60 Celsius / 150 Fahrenheit).
* While we let the dough rise, let’s prepare the tomato/onion base for our pizza. Start by chopping both the tomatoes and onions. In a pan, add a bit of olive oil and half of the chopped onions.

Base, Toppings and Pizza layering

* Let the chopped onions brown, then add the chopped tomatoes and let the mixture cook at medium speed. Add a bit of water if needed, the end result should become a onion/tomato spread that will be used as a base for our pizza. Once read, leave the mixture on the side to cool down.
* Once the dough has doubled in size, it’s time to roll and shape it. Use a rolling pin or your hands to roll and stretch the dough to your desired size.
* Pre-heat the oven to 200 Celsius/400 Fahrenheit.
* Prepare your toppings, dice the mozzarella, chop the peppers and the mushrooms.
* Spread the onion/tomato mixture on your dough.
* Sprinkle your toppings across the dough, starting with the mozzarella, then the veggies (peppers, mushrooms), then the grated cheese.
* Finally, sprinkle oregano.
* Bake your until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10-15 minutes depending on the thickness of your dough.
* Serve warm and enjoy.
