This was an impromptu weekend in Italy over a long weekend thanks to the last bank holiday before Christmas. 

There are days when I get exhausted of planning. I don’t like project management kind of planning but at work a lot of us have to project manage on a day to day basis. So sometimes, in personal life, I just don’t want to decide where to go, where to eat etc. I hate those moments in groups or even with my fiancé when the response on where should we go is “I’m easy”. Well, I am easy too so let’s just eat at home or get a kebab from the = corner-shop. And suddenly the response is - Ah non! Oh, yes! because you were easy. ;) There are times when end up booking 2-3 restaurants to have some solution and to not have crappy food. People think I am the best planner. Not I just can't eat bad food! Enough ranting let's go through the "no planning" weekend fun. :) 

It was the weekend of September 21st in Switzerland and me and my fiancé wanted to explore a new place. And there was this indecisive moment again so I decided we will drive down to Italy with no bookings done. We stopped at the fist decathlon, bought campaign tent. This was our first tent together. I have personally camped only once when I was on a school trip. 

Camping gear cost 

* Tent for 3 (we wanted a spacious tent) - 79 euros 
* Mattress for 2 - 22 euros 
* We had our duvet from home for some comfort. haha 

We then drove towards lake Como. It was quite late in the night. We arrived at the first camping site called
