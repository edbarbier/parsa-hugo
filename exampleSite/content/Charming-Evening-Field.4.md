The most common Indian bread is chapati / roti. Parathas are a bit fancier than chapati and less fancy than naan ;)

**Ingredients**

\- 250 gr Wheat flour

\- 12.5cl Water

\- 200 gr Ghee or melted butter

\- 1tsp Salt

**Method**

1\. In a kitchen robot, add the flour and the salt.

2\. Run the robot on low speed (Speed 1) for four minutes while you slowly add the water.

3\. If you notice that the dough is too sticky, add a few more tbsp of flour and run the robot a bit longer until you get an homogeneous dough.

4\. In the palm of your hand, take enough dough to make a 2-3 inch (5-7cm) diameter ball.

5\. Using a bit of dusting flour, roll the dough into a 6 inch (15 cm) diameter circle.

6\. Spread one tbsp of ghee or melted butter on fold in half.

7\. Spread another tbsp of ghee or butter and fold again in a quarter.

8\. Using additional dusting flour, roll the dough in a triangular shape, aim for 3mm thick.

9\. On a flat pan, cook the paratha from both sides until you get brown speckles. You can spread a bit more ghee or butter while cooking.

10\. Serve warm and enjoy!

Tip

Simple thing to keep in mind with any bread dough. If it's too stick add tsp by tsp flour. If it's dry add water in smaller quantities. My fianc√© is a Belgian. He doesn't have any experience with Indian flour and I struggle him making dough. From his experience I can say that add water slowly and try to bind the flour and water tightly.
