**Ingredients** 

* 420g bonesless chicken 
* 500g tomatoes 
* 50g onion
* 4 cloves garlic 
* 12 pieces cashew
* 3 inch ginger 
* 1 cup yogurt 
* 2 tsp kashmiri red chilli powder 
* 4 tbsp vegetable or mustard oil 
* 2 tbsp lemon juice 
* 1 inch cinnamon stick 
* 1 cardamom 
* 1 black cardamom
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 tsp garam masal powder 
* 6 tbsp butter 
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 2 tbsp red tomato puree
* 1/4 cup cream
* salt to taste
* 1 tbsp chopped coriander
* 1.5 cup water 

**Method**

* Cut chicken into 3 inch long pieces. 
* In a bowl add 2 tbsp lemon juice, one clove grated garlic, 1 inch grated ginger and some salt. Add chicken pieces and ensure that the chicken is well coated in the marinate. Let it sit for 15-20 mins. 
* In a pan add water, roughly chopped tomatoes, onion, cashew, 2 cloves garlic, 1 inch ginger peeled and chopped, cardamoms, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, 1 tsp red chilli powder, 3 tbsp butter and let it cook for 20 minutes or until the tomatoes are well cooked. 
* In a separate bowl add 2 tbsp of oil, add red chilli powder, yogurt and mix well. Drain the previous marinate from the chicken and add the chicken and add it to the new marinate for 15-20 minutes. 
* Once the chicken is marinated, heat 2 tsp oil in a pan. Let the pan get heated on high flame. Once hot add all the chicken and cook it at medium to high flame. Don't turn the chicken a lot. Turn it first time when it's cooked half way through. Cook on the other side and the chicken should be ready. 
* By now the tomatoes must have cooled down. Mix it at high speed in a blender. Strain the gravy so the final dish is creamy and smooth. 
* In a pan, heat 3 tbsp butter at low flame. Add remaining grated ginger, tomato puree, 1tsp red chilli powder, and garam masala. Sautee for 30-60 seconds. Add tomatoe puree and let it simmer for 5 minutes. 
* Add cream, salt, sugar and chicken to the gravy and let it simmer for another 5 minutes. 
* Garnish with chopped coriander and serve warm with naan or rice.
