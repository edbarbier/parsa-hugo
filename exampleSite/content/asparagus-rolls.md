Simple and delicious starters

  
**Recipe** 

Ingredients 

\- 12 Asparagus

\- 1 Puff pastry dough (Buitoni)

\- 4 tbsp Sesame seeds

\- 2 tsp Oil to brush  
  
**Method**

1\. Wash and dry the asparagus.

2\. Cut the pastry dough into 2 cm wide strips. You wonâ€™t be consuming more than half the pastry dough.

3\. Spread the sesame seeds on a plate. Press the strips down over the seeds so the dough is well coated with them.

4\. Take asparagus one by one and cover with the dough strips in a twisted way with the sesame seeds on the outer side. Leave 1.5 inch of asparagus exposed from each side.

5\. Lightly brush the asparagus with oil.

6\. Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees for 10 min and bake for 10 mins or until the dough is crispy golden.

7\. Eat as soup sticks or with any kind of dip or just like this and you will love it.
