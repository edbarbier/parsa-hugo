Ed was craving some indulgent food for the last 2-3 days now. It was Saturday afternoon, 6 pm, and I kick myself out of our couch to try my hand at making dumplings (momos, wontons, gyozas, dim sums) after almost a decade. I was a bit scared and was picturing them bursting in the steamer. LOL On the contrary they were YUMMMM!

**Ingredients** 

This recipe will make decent size 16 dumplings. 

Dough

* 1 1/4 cup multi-purpose flour 
* 3/4 cup warm water 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 2 tsp oil 

Filling 

* 150 gm grated carrot 
* 50 gm very finely chopped cabbage 
* 30 gm finely chopped mushroom
* 1 clove grated garlic 
* 1 stalk spring onion
* Salt to taste 
* 1tbsp cooking oil 
* Pepper to taste 

**Recipe**

* Add oil and salt to the flour and knead with warm water to make a soft but not sticky dough. If the dough is dry please add a tsp by tsp to not leave the dough hard and hard. If it's a bit stick rub some flour and knead well. 
* Leave the dough in a bowl for 30 mins and cover it with a cling foil. 
* In a pan, heat the oil, add all the chopped and grated vegetables and salt and pepper. On medium to high heat, cook the vegetables for 4-5 minutes to dry out the water. 
* Let the filling cool down for 10 mins or so. 
* I made different variations of the filling - added mustard, tabasco, grated panner. Divide the filling into 16 equal parts. 
* Divide the dough in 16 equal pieces. With the help of dry flour, dusting the individual pieces, roll them into 2.5 to 3 inches circular shape. 
* Before you move rolling to the next one, fill in the rolled dough with one portion of the filling and roll in the shape of a dumpling. I will post the video of dumpling rolling on my Instagram account. :) 
* If you have a dumpling steamer you probably know how to use it. If not take you can use a deep pan, a sieve / colander and a lid to cover the sieve / colander. Fill the pan / steamer with water. The water should be enough to create steam, not burn in the process and not be too much that it touches the sieve. 
* Let the water come to boil, oil the sieve / colander / plate of the steamer so when the dumplings cook they don't stick. Place the dumplings with some space in between as when they cook they expand a bit. Cover the dumplings with a lid and cook them in steam for about 7 to 10 mins. You will see the dough skin changing colour. 
* If you want a bit crispy skin, you can add a tsp oil in a pan, 2 tsp of sesame seeds, let them crackle and add dumplings. Cook them for about 2 mins either side on low flame. 
* Eat them with soy sauce, or [Thai sweet chilli sauce](https://www.coop.ch/en/inspiration-gifts/culinary-journey/asia/thai/thai-kitchen-springroll-sauce/p/3020223?context=search) or [Sambal oelek](https://produkte.migros.ch/chop-stick-sambal-oelek) sauce.
