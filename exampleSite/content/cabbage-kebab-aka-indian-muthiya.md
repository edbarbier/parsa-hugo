* 1 tsp coriander powder 
* 2 tsp oil 
* 1 tsp sesame seeds

**Method**

* Add all the dry ingredients and 2 tbsp (except sesame seeds) of oil in a mixing bowl . Mix well and lightly so the cabbage doesn't release water.

* If you have dumpling boiler use it or in a pan take around 200 ml water, bring it to boil and put a flat colander / sieve on the top. Oil the sieve and put the kebabs. Cover with a lid. Let it cook in steam for around 12 minutes
