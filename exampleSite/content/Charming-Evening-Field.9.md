Indians can make parathas with most of the vegetables. They can be either stuffed or mixed with the flour to make a vegetable dough with vegetable puree or finely chopped veggies. 

**Ingredients**

\- 200 gr Fenugreek leaves (Alternative: Spinach, cabbage or similar)

\- 250 gr Plain flour

\- 125 gr Gram flour (or plain flour if not available)

\- 1 pinch Asafoetida

\- 0.5tsp Turmeric powder

\- 1tsp Green chilies

\- 2 tsp Oli

  
**Method**

1\. If you have fenugreek leaves, do not cut them with a knife but roughly make them smaller by breaking them using your hands. If you are using any other leaves roughly chop them

2\. Add the flour, all the spices, the chillies and 2 tsp oil in a bowl

3\. Mix it and knead it using a bit of water until you get a smooth, non-sticky dough

4\. Take a bit of the kneaded dough and make a smooth ball using the dusting flour (it should easily fit in the palm of your hand).

5\. Put it on the rolling disc or your kitchen platform, flatten it using your palm.

6\. Using a bit of dusting four, roll it into a 5 mm thick paratha

7\. Heat a flat pan and put the rolled paratha . Cook it evenly from both sides using a bit of cooking oil.

8\. Add 1 tsp of cooking oil on each side and use a flat spatula to press the paratha once it is cooked.

9\. Take the paratha off the pan once it is evenly brown on both sides.

10\. Serve the parathas with coriander chutney, Indian pickle, yogurt dip, plain butter or even ketchup. The choice is yours.
