I made this cake for Ed over Valentine's Day as for him having delicious dessert is the best gift. ;)

**Ingredients**

* 1.5 cups all purpose flour
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1 cup yogurt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp vanila essence
* 1/2 cup blueberries
* 1/4 cup hot water
* 1/2 cup cooking oil or coconut oil
* 1/4 cup orange juice
* 2 tbsp lemon juice

**Method**

* Pre heat the oven for 10 mins at 180C
* Mix all the dry ingredient and sift through a sieve twice or thrice
* Mix sugar and yogurt well
* Add oil and mix well
* Slowly add the flour mix and keep mixing well ensuring no lumps
* Add orange juice, lemon juice and hot water and mix well
* You can directly add berries or cut them in half and add to the mix with the vanilla essence. Mix well.
* Dust the baking mould of around 18 to 23 inch by first spreading melted butter, then take 2-3 tsp of flour and dust the base and the sides of the buttered mould.
* Transfer the batter to the baking mould and bake for 30-40 minutes at 180 degrees

**Tip -**  If you don't want to add berries, you can simply use a fruit of your choice or no fruit at all. If you don't have orange juice and lemon juice add a bit of warm milk to get the right consistency to the batter. By right consistency I mean the batter shouldn't be very tight but slightly flowing as in when you take it in a spoon and drop in the mould it should flow.

**Icing**

* 220g mascarpone cheese or cream cheese
* 125g double / heavy chilled cream
* 1 cup icing or powdered sugar 
* 1 tsp vanilla essence

**Method**

* Beat the cheese and sugar for 2-3 minutes until it makes a consistent mix
* Add the essence and cream and beat at medium speed for around 5-7 minutes. Don't beat it too high or for too long to avoid the cream curdling. 
* If the cream is runny give a good fast whip for a minute or so and try adding a bit more sugar or cream and whip again. You can also let it sit in the fridge and whip again. 
* It's all about test and learn so don't worry much just give it a go!
